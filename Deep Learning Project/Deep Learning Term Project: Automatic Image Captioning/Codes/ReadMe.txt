- All the necessary imports are already done and some installations that are required are also done in the notebooks.

- Feel free to run them cell by cell.

- The notebooks have been made the way asked in the assignment. It was done in Kaggle so it better advised to run this in Kaggle notebook.

- The dataset that I have used is made public and available in Kaggle named as "dataset_zipped" (size : 285 MB)

- Make sure to keep the dataset name same. You can incorporate it in your own notebook.
